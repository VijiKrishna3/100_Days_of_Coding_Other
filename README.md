# 100 Days of Coding

## What is this
100 Days of Coding is a challenge designed by Jamal Errakibi (@coder.journey) to help people solve problems faster.

This is [my repository of solutions](http://github.com/dimitri-dev) for the challenge.

All the solutions here presented are done in other languages, but not C#.

If you want to see my solutions in C#, take a look at my other main repository: https://github.com/dimitri-dev/100_Days_of_Coding

## How can I participate
100 Days of Coding is a personal challenge, and you can subscribe to the mail list [by clicking here.](http://eepurl.com/hfEaK5)

Don't worry if you cannot solve the tasks on a daily basis - do it at your own pace!

## What if I'm stuck
Jamal Errakibi has also opened up a Discord server where users can share their solutions, get opinions on how to improve from others,
and ask other solvers to explain their algorithms.
